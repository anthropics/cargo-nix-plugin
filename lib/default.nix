# Nix wrapper that connects the cargo-nix-plugin output to buildRustCrate.
#
# Usage (lockfile resolve):
#   let
#     cargoNix = import ./lib {
#       inherit pkgs;
#       src = ./.;  # workspace root with Cargo.toml + Cargo.lock
#     };
#   in cargoNix.workspaceMembers
#
# Usage (explicit metadata — pre-generated cargo metadata JSON):
#   let
#     cargoNix = import ./lib {
#       inherit pkgs;
#       metadata = builtins.readFile ./metadata.json;
#       cargoLock = builtins.readFile ./Cargo.lock;
#       src = ./.;  # workspace root
#     };
#   in cargoNix.workspaceMembers
#
# Clippy: use `clippy` to get per-workspace-member clippy checks that
# reuse Nix-cached dependency builds:
#   cargoNix.clippy.allWorkspaceMembers  # check all members
#   cargoNix.clippy.workspaceMembers.<name>.build  # check one member

  # --- Clippy support ---
  # clippy-driver is a drop-in replacement for rustc.  We build a small
  # wrapper package that exposes `bin/rustc` → clippy-driver so that
  # buildRustCrate (which calls `noisily rustc …`) runs clippy instead.
  # Dependencies are built with the real rustc (and cached); only
  # workspace members use the clippy wrapper.
  #
  # All workspace members are consistently built with clippy-driver so
  # that inter-workspace-member dependencies have matching rlib metadata.
